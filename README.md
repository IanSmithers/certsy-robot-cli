## Background

This is an implementation of a REPL CLI that controls a robot navigating a surface. The robot can accept certain commands and operates within certain boundaries.

The goals for this repository were to demonstrate good code knowledge and practices.

1. Contains production quality code.
2. Demonstrates good OO and functional programming practices.
3. Incorporates a solid testing approach.
4. Displays code that has well thought out naming.
5. Has solid error handling.
6. Is easily extensible and maintainable.
7. Has good design from a software engineering perspective.
8. Displays separation of concerns.
9. Breaks code down into sensible files and modules.
10. Uses best practices/idioms when it comes to language, testing etc.
11. Has an appropriate use of tools and frameworks.

The project was built with the following packages.

- typescript
- node
- jest
- babel
- bandersnatch

Additionally for development runtime execution it uses `ts-node` and `ts-jest`.
